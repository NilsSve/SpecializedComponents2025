This view lets you experiment with the new collating system. 

You may type characters and determine the sort order that they will be in, considering the locale selected and the other attributes specified through the radio groups. 

You may also create a TXT file containing characters from a language (one character/word per line; each line CRLF terminated) and import it into the Unsorted List. Note that space will always be added as one line to the imported list. The demo includes a file (Collate_EN_Characters.txt) containing characters from the American-EN keyboard for you to experiment with.
